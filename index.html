            <h3>Final Year Project: Visual Odometry Evaluation and Experimentation</h3>
            <p class="indented-text">During my 3rd Year at University, my final project was to create a program that explores Visual Odometry, and experiments with different approaches and their properties. Its intended as an introduction for both myself and the reader to the topic, since its a deeply researched area that my course at the time barely explored.</p>
            <h3>"Embed" Extensions: </h3>
            <p class="indented-text">In November of 2023, as an experiment to teach myself how to create browser extensions, I asked my friends what small thing bugs them about their browsing experience, and the answer i got back was that they hated having to retype their URLs in Discord due to embedding issues, and was common with Twitter/X and TikTok. I found an old extension that did something very similar, but now is non-functioning. Changes in Twitter's structure caused the extension to cease working. I figured out the faults present in the program, fixed it and added new features of my own. I also applied this to TikTok, making it just that bit easier for my friends to share the posts they found on those sites.</p>
            <h3>Animation and Rigging Experiments</h3>
            <p class="indented-text">While working on my University Projects and Courses, to find something to distract from the work given in downtime, I dedicated myself to learning more about lighting and animation techniques in 3D modelling software. I chose <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> to explore this in, and I've been working on this project for years now in the background. This has given me the opportunity to teach myself how to create driver-based controls to manipulate rigs in blender, through Python scripting.</p>

            <h3>Second Year Software Engineering Course: Bug fixing and Feature Implementation</h3>
            <p class="indented-text">During my 2nd Year of University, I was assigned with a group of other students to develop for an open source 2D MMO called <a href="https://stendhalgame.org/">'Stendhal.'</a> It entailed of navigating a large, unfamiliar codebase, familiarising ourselves with its structure in a short timeframe before fixing existing bugs in the repo and implementing new features based on existing mechanics within the game's code.</p>
